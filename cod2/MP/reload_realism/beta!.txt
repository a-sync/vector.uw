The reloading system will have the reload realism, and it will be used as a stand alone mod.
(There will be versions to support other mods like ASD, PAM, AWE etc.)

This alpha is the last developement of the reload realism for CoD2 v1.01.
The code will be implented into the CoD2 v1.3 gametype scripts separeted and optimised.
